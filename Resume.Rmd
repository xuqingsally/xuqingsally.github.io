##Interest  
With a Master' s degree in biostatistics and experience of 1 year of data analysis and modeling in clinical data, I did projects of large interview population-based study, data manipulation, survival analysis, prediction model of psychosis and machine learning. I am familiar with SAS and R and very interested in clinical trials, longitudinal study, predictive models for health outcome and wish to contribute to research in healthcare.
