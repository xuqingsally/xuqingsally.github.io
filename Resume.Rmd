##Summary 
With a Master' s degree in biostatistics and experience of 1 year of data analysis and modeling in clinical data, I did projects of large interview population-based study, longitudinal and survival analysis, clinical trials, prediction model and machine learning of psychosis and behavior outcome. I am very interested in clinical trials, predictive models for health outcome with longitudinal data.
