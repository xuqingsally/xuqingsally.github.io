##Overview
In this series of studies among High-Risk Patients, we want to figure out the factors that influence the probability of conversion to psychosis and build predict model based on demographc, brain image measurments and symptoms.  

<br>

##Intensification of Symptoms enhance prediction of conversion to psychosis
We are preparing a paper of this project.

<br>

##Risk Calculator
We make a website of risk calculator to predict the probability of conversion to psychosis based on lasso logistic regression.
